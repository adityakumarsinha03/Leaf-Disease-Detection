# Leaf-Disease-Detection

The level of agricultural production is crucial to a nation's economic growth. The biggest obstacle to the production and quality of food, though, is plant
disease. Early detection of plant diseases is essential for maintaining global health and welfare. The standard method of diagnosis entails a pathologist
visiting the location and visually evaluating each plant. However, due to lower accuracy and limited accessibility of human resources, manual examination for
various plant diseases is limited. To address these problems, it is necessary to develop automated methods that can quickly identify and classify a wide range
of plant diseases. The presence of low-intensity information in the image background and foreground, the extreme colour similarity between healthy and
diseased plant areas, the presence of noise in the samples, and changes in the position, chrominance, structure, and size of plant leaves make it difficult to
accurately identify and classify plant diseases. We have developed a reliable plant disease classification system using an InceptionV3 Architecture to address
the aforementioned issues. In this research, we suggested a deep learning strategy based on InceptionV3 Architecture to identify leaf diseases in a variety
of plants. Finding the plant disease and its classification is our aim. The referenced dataset is taken from the well-known public source kaggle. The
dataset consists of 70,295 Plant images of Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn (maize), Grape, Orange, Peach, Pepper bell, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean,
Strawberry and Tomato. The suggested method has the capacity to handle complex situations from a plant's area and can successfully identify various
forms of diseases.
